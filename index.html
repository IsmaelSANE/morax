    <h2>THE FOUNDERS</h2>
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe,
      and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication taught by
      the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a billion people, and probably
      more.

            Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility,
            Michael is the creator of the
            <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails
            Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
            <a href="https://learnenough.com/">
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. Michael
            is also notorious as the founder of
            <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and author of
            <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau
            Manifesto</em></a>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
            are slightly exaggerated.

            When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on
            his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
            interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
            interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
            Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at
            heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour
            bus as he is from his kitchen table.
